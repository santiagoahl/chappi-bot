"In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is ""Pa"" is the nominative form, ""Mato"" is the accusative form, and ""Sing"" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is ""Maktay"". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is ""Tay"", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is ""Aktay"". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as ""is pleasing to"", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is ""Apple"" is the nominative form, ""Zapple"" is the accusative form, and ""Izapple"" is the genitive form. 

Please translate ""I like apples"" to Tizin.",,"""Maktay Zapple Pa""",Maktay mato apple,0

"Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show ""Pick That Ping-Pong"". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.",,"To maximize your odds of winning the big prize, you should choose ball number `1`.",3,0

"You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: ""How many vampires are living in Șirnea"". Everyone in the village gives the same response, ""At least one of us is a human.""

How many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?",,99,100,0

How many more blocks (also denoted as layers) in BERT base encoder than the encoder from the architecture proposed in Attention is All You Need?,,"To determine the difference in the number of blocks (or layers) between the BERT base encoder and the encoder from the ""Attention is All You Need"" architecture, we need to know the number of layers in each model:

1. **BERT Base Encoder**: It has 12 layers.
2. **Attention is All You Need (Transformer) Encoder**: It has 6 layers.

Now, we can calculate the difference:

12 (BERT Base) - 6 (Transformer) = 6

Therefore, the BERT base encoder has 6 more layers than the encoder from the ""Attention is All You Need"" architecture.",6,0
