"Hi, I'm making a pie but I could use some help with my shopping list. I have everything I need for the crust, but I'm not sure about the filling. I got the recipe from my friend Aditi, but she left it as a voice memo and the speaker on my phone is buzzing so I can't quite make out what she's saying.
