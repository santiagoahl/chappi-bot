"Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show ""Pick That Ping-Pong"". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.",,"To maximize your odds of winning the grand prize, you should choose ball number **1**.",3,0

"In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. 

The word that indicates oneself is ""Pa"" is the nominative form, ""Mato"" is the accusative form, and ""Sing"" is the genitive form. 

The root verb that indicates an intense like for something is ""Maktay"". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is ""Tay"", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is ""Aktay"". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as ""is pleasing to"", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.

The word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is ""Apple"" is the nominative form, ""Zapple"" is the accusative form, and ""Izapple"" is the genitive form. 

Please translate ""I like apples"" to Tizin.",,"""Maktay Zapple Pa""",Maktay mato apple,0
