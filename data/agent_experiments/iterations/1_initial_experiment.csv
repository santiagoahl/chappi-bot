"If Eliud Kipchoge could maintain his record-making marathon pace indefinitely, how many thousand hours would it take him to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon its closest approach? Please use the minimum perigee value on the Wikipedia page for the Moon when carrying out your calculation. Round your result to the nearest 1000 hours and do not use any comma separators if necessary.","To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the distance from Earth to the Moon at its closest approach (perigee).**
   - According to Wikipedia, the minimum perigee distance is approximately 356,500 km.

2. **Find Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace.**
   - Kipchoge's marathon world record is 2 hours, 1 minute, and 39 seconds for 42.195 km.
   - Convert this time to hours: \(2 + \frac{1}{60} + \frac{39}{3600} \approx 2.0275\) hours.
   - Calculate his speed: \( \frac{42.195}{2.0275} \approx 20.82 \) km/h.

3. **Calculate the time it would take to run the distance to the Moon.**
   - Use the formula: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - \( \text{Time} = \frac{356,500}{20.82} \approx 17120.65 \) hours.

4. **Convert the time to thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000.**
   - \( \frac{17120.65}{1000} \approx 17.12065 \).
   - Rounded to the nearest 1000 hours: 17000.

The answer is:

"You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, Lațcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of Șirnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.

You travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.

In the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: ""How many vampires are living in Șirnea"". Everyone in the village gives the same response, ""At least one of us is a human.""

How many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?",99,100,0

"Here's a fun riddle that I think you'll enjoy.

You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show ""Pick That Ping-Pong"". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.

A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.

The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.

Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.","To maximize your odds of winning the big prize, you should choose ball number `1`.",3,0
