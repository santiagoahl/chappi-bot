"An office held a Secret Santa gift exchange where each of its twelve employees was assigned one other employee in the group to present with a gift. Each employee filled out a profile including three likes or hobbies. On the day of the gift exchange, only eleven gifts were given, each one specific to one of the recipient's interests. Based on the information in the document, who did not give a gift?","To determine who did not give a gift, we need to identify the employee who did not present a gift to their assigned recipient. Since there are twelve employees and only eleven gifts were given, one employee did not fulfill their Secret Santa obligation.

Given that each gift was specific to the recipient's interests, we can deduce that the missing gift corresponds to the employee whose interests were not matched with a gift. Therefore, the employee who did not give a gift is the one whose assigned recipient did not receive a gift.

Without specific information about the interests and the gifts given, we cannot directly identify the employee. However, if you provide the list of employees, their interests, and the gifts given, I can help determine who did not give a gift.",Fred,0
"Bob was invited to participate in a game show, and he advanced to the final round. The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.

If Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?","To solve this problem, we need to determine the distribution of coins in the boxes that satisfies the given conditions and then find Bob's optimal strategy to maximize his winnings.

### Conditions:
1. Total coins = 30
2. One box must contain at least 2 coins.
3. One box must contain 6 more coins than another box.

### Analysis:
Let's denote the number of coins in the three boxes as \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) such that \( x + y + z = 30 \).

- Without loss of generality, assume \( x \leq y \leq z \).
- From the conditions, we have:
  - \( x \geq 2 \)
  - \( z = x + 6 \)

### Solving the Equations:
Substitute \( z = x + 6 \) into the total:
\[ x + y + (x + 6) = 30 \]
\[ 2x + y + 6 = 30 \]
\[ 2x + y = 24 \]
\[ y = 24 - 2x \]

Since \( x \leq y \), we have:
\[ x \leq 24 - 2x \]
\[ 3x \leq 24 \]
\[ x \leq 8 \]

### Possible Values for \( x \):
- \( x \) can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.

### Calculate \( y \) and \( z \) for each \( x \):
- For \( x = 2 \): \( y = 20 \), \( z = 8 \) (invalid as \( y \geq z \))
- For \( x = 3 \): \( y = 18 \), \( z = 9 \) (invalid as \( y \geq z \))
- For \( x = 4 \): \( y = 16 \), \( z = 10 \) (invalid as \( y \geq z \))
- For \( x = 5 \): \( y = 14 \), \( z = 11 \) (valid)
- For \( x = 6 \): \( y = 12 \), \( z = 12 \) (valid)
- For \( x = 7 \): \( y = 10 \), \( z = 13 \) (valid)
- For \( x = 8 \): \( y = 8 \), \( z = 14 \) (valid)

### Optimal Strategy:
Bob should guess the minimum number of coins in each box to ensure he wins at least that many coins. The optimal strategy is to guess the minimum number of coins in each box configuration.

### Minimum Winnings:
- For \( (x, y, z) = (5, 14, 11) \), Bob guesses 5, 11, 11 → Wins 5 + 11 + 11 = 27 coins
- For \( (x, y, z) = (6, 12, 12) \), Bob guesses 6, 12, 12 → Wins 6 + 12 + 12 = 30 coins
- For \( (x, y, z) = (7, 10, 13) \), Bob guesses 7, 10, 10 → Wins 7 + 10 + 10 = 27 coins
- For \( (x, y, z) = (8, 8, 14) \), Bob guesses 8, 8, 8 → Wins 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 coins

The minimum amount of money Bob can win, using the optimal strategy, is when the distribution is \( (8, 8, 14) \), and he wins 24 coins.

### Conclusion:
The minimum amount of money Bob can win is \( 24,000 \) dollars.",16000,0

"Hi, I'm making a pie but I could use some help with my shopping list. I have everything I need for the crust, but I'm not sure about the filling. I got the recipe from my friend Aditi, but she left it as a voice memo and the speaker on my phone is buzzing so I can't quite make out what she's saying.

In your response, please only list the ingredients, not any measurements. So if the recipe calls for ""a pinch of salt"" or ""two cups of ripe strawberries"" the ingredients on the list would be ""salt"" and ""ripe strawberries"".
