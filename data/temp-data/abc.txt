Arithmetic has to deal with elementarylbasic levels of math, such as division , multiplication , subtraction
and addition_ Basically; just working with numbers
This SHOULD be
evel familiar with you_ If you are not familiar with arithmetic mathirules
then PLEASE review through Arithmetic
as you won't survive even the Ist step of Algebra
Trust me
the basics are THAT important

Fractions (from Latin fractus; "broken") are parts of a whole. In the image of a cake, there is only 3/4's of the cake showing
the other 1/4 has been eatenitaken away:
The number; 3,in 3/4
is what is known as
numerator (Numerator: Number at the top, tells uS of how much of the number is being talked aboutbeing used) The number; 4, in 3/4
is what
1/4
Is known as
denominator (Denominator: Number showing the all time total)
Simplest formlreduced form
A reduced form of a fraction is
fraction that cannot be divided by
number other than
and the denominator is greater than
So 2/4 is NOT in simplest form, since we can divide 2
and 4, by 2__ which results in the following number
Though;
not every iraction can be divided by 2
there are fractions
such as
5/35
/21
and
30/5-
The two first iractions are not
divisible by 2
and 30/5 can not be divided by
on both sides, but only on 30_
It's important to simplify as if you were in
test, your teacher will mark your problems as incorrect if you didnt
Cake with fractions
4x 3 = 12 (multiplication)
simplify your fractions. It's also important to note that
simplified fraction and the non-simplified fraction (that, if simplified
equals that fraction) are the same, and represent the same
quantity- So
and
3
represents the same quantity;
halfl
Here
we will present
few fractions for you to simplify
