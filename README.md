## **🧠 Architecture**

Chappie is a ********React-style agent********, meaning it follows a loop of:

1. ********Reason******** about the query
2. ********Act******** by calling a tool if needed
3. ********Observe******** the result
4. ********Repeat or respond********

The logic is built using ********LangGraph********, which provides a composable and stateful way to define agent workflows.
